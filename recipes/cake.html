    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) bottles red food coloring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake pans.</li>
        <li>Pour red food coloring into a small bowl, and mix with cocoa powder to make a paste. In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup of butter, sugar, and eggs with an electric mixer until smooth and thoroughly combined; mix in the red color mixture, salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Gradually mix in the buttermilk, alternating with flour, until the batter is smooth. Mix the baking soda and vinegar in a small bowl, and stir into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing cakes to finish cooling on racks.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mash cream cheese with 1/2 cup softened butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract until smooth and creamy; stir in the confectioners' sugar, about half a cup at a time, until the frosting is thick and spreadable. Frost fully-cooled layers.</li>
    </ol>
